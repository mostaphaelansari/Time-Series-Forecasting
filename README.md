# Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting for store sales. We use historical sales data to predict future sales trends, which can be crucial for inventory management, staffing decisions, and overall business strategy.

## Data Exploration (EDA.ipynb)
Our Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted in the `EDA.ipynb` notebook. This analysis includes:

1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
   - Loading the dataset
   - Checking for missing values
   - Examining data types and basic statistics

2. Time Series Visualization
   - Plotting overall sales trends
   - Visualizing weekly patterns
   - Identifying seasonal trends

3. Feature Analysis
   - Exploring correlations between different features
   - Analyzing the impact of various factors on sales

4. Outlier Detection
   - Identifying and investigating unusual sales patterns

5. Time-based Patterns
   - Examining daily, weekly, and monthly sales patterns
   - Investigating holiday effects on sales

## Next Steps
- Feature engineering based on EDA insights
- Model selection and training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (list them in a `requirements.txt` file)
3. Open and run the `EDA.ipynb` notebook to see the exploratory data analysis
